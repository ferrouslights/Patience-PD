## How to Play
- Patience is a real-time bonsai growing game. As the name suggests, this is not a game that can be completed quickly, as it requires you to periodically check in on your plant from time to time. Usually once a week.
- Water your plant before its water level gets too low. If left dry too long, your bonsai will die, and you'll have to start over!
- Fertilizing your bonsai will help it grow quicker, but it will also dry out faster, so be aware of when your bonsai is fertilized!
- Enjoy the game, and be sure to water your plants in real life too :)
